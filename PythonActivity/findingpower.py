#Given the base x and the power y and we have to find the x to the power y using recursion in Python.

#By using recursion â€“ We will be multiplying a number (initially with value 1) by the number input by the user (of which we have to find the value of yth power) for y times. For multiplying it by y times, we need to call our function y times. Since we know the number of times function will execute, so we are using for recursion.
